The project utilizes PostgreSQL to store stock market data into an RDBMS, separating the application from the data storage. Apache Tomcat is used to handle incoming HTTP requests from the client and communicates with the application to return the specified request. Custom DockerFiles configuration makes the application setup accessible to the end-user, and the containerization of the program makes it comprehensive and easy to use.",
