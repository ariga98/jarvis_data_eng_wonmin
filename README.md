# Wonmin Jeong . Jarvis Consulting
Detail-oriented graduate from the Electrical Engineering discipline with experience in project management. 
As a junior Data Engineering developer, I have familiarized myself with the core concepts of the subject and have gained valuable practice in using software 
that is prevalent in the industry. Furthermore, soft skills like interpersonal communication and diverse collaboration have been proven through  various professional development experiences. 
I am seeking to utilize the practical and analytical knowledge developed in personal projects and 
academia to leverage a challenging career path in the field of data engineering.

## Skills
**Proficient:** Java, Bash, SQL, Agile/Scrum, Git/GitFlow

**Competent:** SpringBoot, JUnit Testing, Matlab, Docker, Mockito, Algorithm & Data Structures

**Familiar:** Spring Framework, REST API, Python, C, Assembly

## Development Project
Project Source Code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Wonmin](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Wonmin)

- **[Cluster Monitor:](./linux_sql)** Implemented a Linux cluster monitoring agent that records the hardware specification of each host machine and monitors their memory usage in real-time. The project was primarily developed using bash scripts that are integrated with the PostgreSQL database. Using Docker for containerization, the end product is light-weight, versatile, and easy to use.

- **[Core Java Apps:](./core_java)** Attained in-depth knowledge of Java by developing three separate applications. The first application, JavaGrep, utilizes the Stream API and Lambda expressions to replicate the grep command used in bash within Java. The second project initiated the use of JDBC and design patterns such as DAOs. The third application works with the Twitter API to allow simple CRUD operations. The project follows the MVC architecture and is tested with JUnit and Mockito.

- **[SpringBoot App:](./springboot)** Developed a three-tier microservice application that simulates an online trading platform allowing transactions between traders, processing buy/sell orders and updating existing quotes present in the market. The project utilizes PostgreSQL to store stock market data into an RDBMS, separating the application from the data storage. Apache Tomcat is used to handle incoming HTTP requests from the client and communicates with the application to return the specified request. Custom DockerFiles configuration makes the application setup accessible to the end-user, and the containerization of the program makes it comprehensive and easy to use.

- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)** Not Started

- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)** Not Started

- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)** Not Started

## Professional Experiences
**Software Developer, Jarvis, Toronto (2020-Present):** Utilizing Java as the primary development language, the experience has allowed me to delve into Java fundamentals and it's core applications. Multiple projects introduced concepts that assimilated Java with SQL and Bash, granting in-depth knowledge of software integration and testing. Furthermore, each project introduced critical development concepts like Git/GitFlow and Agile/Scrum.

**Freelance Translator, UpWork, Toronto (2016-2018):** Being contract-based in nature, the work consisted of strict deadlines and diverse clients which allowed thorough development of effective communication and quality assurance. Furthermore, the work verified my ability as a self-starter with networking and management capabilities.

## Education & Academic Projects
**McMaster University (2016-2020)**, Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering

- **Hearing Aid Development:** Designed and developed a prototype hearing aid that selectively tunes different 
audio sources utilizing EEG signals from the brain. My responsibilities within the team were feature selection using Matlab and
application development using Python (PyAudio, PyWave) and microcontrollers.

- **Digital Inclination Measurement System:** Developed and implemented a microcontroller embedded prototype to acquire the angular position by processing the raw data and 
transmitting the output to a user-friendly GUI within Matlab. The core application consisted of quantifying the analog signal, analog to digital conversion, and data processing.

## Certificates & Awards & Activities
- Executive Leader, Youth With A Mission (2017-2020): Executive leader of a campus club involving mission trips and volunteering activities

- Entrance Scholarship (2016)
